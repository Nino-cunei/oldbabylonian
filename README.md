Proto-cuneiform corpora in Text-Fabric
--------------------------------------

This repo is a research environment for the study of cuneiform tablets. You can
run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.

Corpus
------

This repo contains transliterations of Old Babylonian letters (1900-1600 BC).

The data is obtained from [CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu), the Cuneiform Digital
Library Initiative.

See also
[about](docs/about.md)
and
[transcription](docs/transcription.md).

Software
--------

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric/).
It is instrumental to
turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.

Getting started
===============

Start with the
[tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/annotation/tutorials/blob/master/oldbabylonian/start.ipynb).
