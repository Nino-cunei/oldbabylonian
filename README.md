# Cuneiform corpora in Text-Fabric

This repo is a research environment for the study of cuneiform tablets. You can
run your own programs off-line, and publish your work in online notebooks.

# Corpus

This repo contains transliterations of Old Babylonian letters (1900-1600 BC).

The data is obtained from [CDLI](https://cdli.ucla.edu), the Cuneiform Digital
Library Initiative.

See also
[about](docs/about.md)
and
[transcription](https://github.com/Nino-cunei/tfFromAtf/blob/master/docs/transcription.md).

# Software

The main processing tool is [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric/).
It is instrumental to
turn the analysis of ancient data into computing narratives.

The ecosystem is Python and Jupyter notebooks.

# Getting started

Start with the
[tutorial](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nino-cunei/oldbabylonian/blob/master/tutorial/start.ipynb).
