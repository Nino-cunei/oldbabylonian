248237	To Šamaš-ḫazir
speak,
thus Hammurapi:
Ilī-ippalsam, the shepherd,
thus informed me, as follows that one:
A field of 3 bur3, which through a sealed document of my lord
was given (lit. sealed) to me—
4 years ago Etel-pî-Marduk took it away from me, and
its barley regularly takes.
Further, Sîn-iddinam I informed,
but it was not returned to me;
Thus he (Ilī-ippalsam) informed me.
To Sîn-iddinam I (now) have written.
If, as that Ilī-ippalsam
said,
a field of 3 bur3, which in the palace
was given (lit. sealed) to him,
Etel-pî-Marduk 4 years ago took away, and
is ‘eating,′
then a more sickening case
does not exist.
With this matter
deal well, and
the field that according to the wording of the sealed document
in the palace was sealed for him,
to Ili-ippalsam have returned.
Further, the barley that for 4 years
on that field Etel-pî-Marduk
has been taking regularly,
through the divine weapon investigate, and
to Ilī-ippalsam, the shepherd,
give!
Further, a report regarding this litigation
send here!
250297	To Nūr-Šamaš
speak!
Thus Šamaš-nāṣir;
may Šamaš and Marduk keep you well!
From Tur-Ugalla
7 bandicoots did Tutu-māgir
send me;
6 to Šamaš-lamassašu, the ‘mirror-holder,’
I sent on;
just one for my own repast
I kept back,
and it tasted excellent!
How good they were had I but known,
a single one to Šamaš-lamassašu
I’d not have sent!
Now, my tablet I've sent to you:
when to Tur-Ugalla
you go down, to the orchardist who right there
lives speak!
15 bandicoots from the ground
he should dig up for me and send them here.
Further: a ram for ...
that I mentioned to you, send here!
250748	To Zinu
speak,
thus Iddin-Sin:
May Shamash, Marduk, and Ninshubur
for my sake forever
sustain you!
The garments of others
year for year
are improving,
but as for you, my garments
year for year
you reduce!
In my garments
reducing and ...-ing,
you have become rich!
With respect to the wool in our estate,
which like bread is being consumed,
my garments you reduce!
The son of Adad-iddinam,
whose father is an underling of my father,
two new garments,
wears, but as for you, about my single garment
you keep obsessing!
Although you to me
gave birth,
and as to him, his mother
in adoption
adopted him,
yet although as to him,
his mother loves him,
you, you do not really love me.
257465	To Dadâ
and Sîn-uselli
speak,
thus Šēp-Sîn:
“May Šamaš and Ašnan
for my sake forever
keep you well!”
Thus I wrote you,
thus me:
“Both of you, you and Sîn-uselli,
tin sweepings and their powder,
leeks, perfumed oils, juniper,
and 2 talents of copper
gather for me.
Even a short day do not delay!
And one son of Susa
as your partner
with you
should go.”
Thus I wrote you.
What you yourselves,
thus you:
‛We shall have it brought.’
On the day my letter,
you see,
both of you, do not delay!
I heard your words.
together with the king’s soldiers
and the king’s letter,
up to Larsa,
for you
of non-interference
in al-Aḫa-nūta.
I will be ready. From now,
5 days hence, I shall see you.
10 talents of juniper and 1 talent resin
may he give.
One the other ...
must not hinder.
Both of you together,
you and Sîn-uselli,
directly your faces I shall see.
While in al-Aḫa-nūta
together with the kings soldier(s)
I am staying,
directly your faces I shall see.”
